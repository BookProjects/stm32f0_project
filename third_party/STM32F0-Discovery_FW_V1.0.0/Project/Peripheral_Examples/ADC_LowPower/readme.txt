@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral with 
Auto-delayed conversion mode and Auto-poweroff modes.

The ADC is triggered by TIM3_TRGO which is connected to TIM3_Update Event.
Each time the ADC is triggered, it converts the input voltage connected to PC.1 
(which correspond to ADC channel11), and then the ADC enter in delay mode (no
Overun detect) until the ADC data register has been read by pressing USER button.

@note The "system_stm32f0xx.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F0xx devices, and is customized for use with STM32F0-Discovery Kit. 
      The STM32F0xx is configured to run at 48 MHz, following the three  
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system 
             clock source.  
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE          
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some 
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS   
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from 
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as 
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE 
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f0xx.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSI).

         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F0-Discovery (MB1034) 
    RevB and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    
  - STM32F0-Discovery Set-up
    - Connect the external signal(ranges from 0 to 3.3V) to the ADC1 pin (PC.01) to be converted.
    - Connect an amperemeter to JP2 to measure the IDD current.
