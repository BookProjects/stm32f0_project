@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure external interrupt lines.
In this example, one EXTI line (EXTI0) when using the STM32F0-Discovery kit is
configured to generate an interrupt on each falling edge. In the interrupt routine
leds connected to a specific GPIO pins are toggled.

In this example, EXTI0 is mapped to PA0.

After EXTI configuration, a software interrupt is generated on the EXTI0 toggles
LED3 and LED4.
After that, when falling edge is detected on EXTI0, LED3 and LED4 toggle.

If STM32F0-Discovery kit is used,when User-button is pressed,LED3 and LED4 toggle.

In this example, EXTI0_Config() function can be substituted by
STM_EVAL_PBInit(BUTTON_USER, Mode_EXTI) provided in the STM32F0-Discovery driver.

@note The "system_stm32f0xx.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F0xx devices, and is customized for use with STM32F0-Discovery Kit.
      The STM32F0xx is configured to run at 48 MHz, following the three
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f0xx.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSI).


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F0-Discovery (MB1034)
    RevB and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
