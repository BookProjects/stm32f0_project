@par Example Description

This example shows how to enter the system to WFI mode and wake-up from this mode
by the User key interrupt.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 48 MHz. When the user presses
on the User Key Button, the MCU enters in mode WFI. If the user presses again on
the User Key Button, LED3 is toggled with a frequency depending on the system clock,
this is used to indicate whether the MCU is in WFI or RUN mode.

Pressing key push button (generates rising edge on EXTI Line0) will put the core
in the WFI mode, causing the LED3 to stop toggling.
To wake-up from WFI mode you have to press again on the button which generates an
interrupt which exits the system from WFI mode.
The LED3 restarts toggling.

@note The "system_stm32f0xx.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F0xx devices, and is customized for use with STM32F0-Discovery Kit.
      The STM32F0xx is configured to run at 48 MHz, following the three
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f0xx.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSI).


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F0-Discovery (MB1034)
    RevB and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F0-Discovery Set-up
   - Press on User button to enter and exit the WFI mode.
