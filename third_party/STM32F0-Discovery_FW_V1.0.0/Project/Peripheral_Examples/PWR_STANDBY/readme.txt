@par Example Description

This example shows how to enter the system to STANDBY mode and wake-up from this
mode using RTC Alarm.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 48 MHz, the SysTick is programmed
to generate an interrupt each 250 ms. In the SysTick interrupt handler, the LED3 is
toggled, this is used to indicate whether the MCU is in STANDBY or RUN mode.

When a falling edge is detected on the PA0(pressing on user button), the RTC is
configured to generate an Alarm event in 3 seconds then the system enters STANDBY
mode causing the LED3 to stop toggling.
An external RESET will wake-up the system from STANDBY. If within 3 seconds an
external RESET is not generated, the RTC Alarm will wake-up the system.

After wake-up from STANDBY mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a RESET, the LED3 is toggling again,the RTC configuration(clock source, enable, prescaler,...)
is kept.
As result there is no need to configure the RTC.

Led LED3 is used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LED3 toggling: system in RUN mode
 - LED3 off : system in STANDBY mode

@note The "system_stm32f0xx.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F0xx devices, and is customized for use with STM32F0-Discovery Kit.
      The STM32F0xx is configured to run at 48 MHz, following the three
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f0xx.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSI).

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F0-Discovery (MB1034)
    RevB and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F0-Discovery board Set-up
    - Use LD3 connected respectively to PC.09 pin.
    - Use USER push button connected to PA.0 pin.
