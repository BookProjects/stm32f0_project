@par Example Description

This example describes how to configure the TIM to trigger the ADC conversion.

In this example the TIM1 is configured in PWM mode, the TIM1 CC4 event is used
to trigger the ADC.

The ADC is configured to convert continuously the ADC_Channel_11 (connected to
an external voltage).
Each time the TIM1 CC4 event occurs, the ADC convert the variable voltage.

@note The "system_stm32f0xx.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F0xx devices, and is customized for use with STM32F0-Discovery Kit.
      The STM32F0xx is configured to run at 48 MHz, following the three
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.7 OSC clock" in "STM32F0 discovery kit User manual (UM1525)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f0xx.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSI).


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F0-Discovery (MB1034)
    RevB and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F0-Discovery Set-up
    - Connect the external signal ranges between 0 and 3.3V to ADC pin (PC.01).
